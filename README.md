This repo is a selection of some fun coding questions to practice raw logic, algorithms and creative problem-solving.

### 1. Biggest Island

Given a 2D array (i.e., a matrix) containing only 1s (land) and 0s (water), find the biggest island in it. Write a function to return the area of the biggest island. An island is a connected set of 1s (land) and is surrounded by either an edge or 0s (water). Each cell is considered connected to other cells horizontally or vertically (not diagonally).
